### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My full name is Tran Pham Minh Khuy and I'm based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

I am a friendly and passionate developer. I thrive on creating innovative solutions and constantly expanding my knowledge in the field of development. With a deep passion for technology and a friendly demeanor, I enjoy collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. I believe in building strong relationships and fostering a positive environment for effective teamwork.

Currently, I am expanding my skills to the full-stack developer, and I am looking for remote or hybrid job opportunities as a front-end developer.
